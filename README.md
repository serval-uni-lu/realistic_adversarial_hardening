# Realistic adversarial hardening
This repository contains the data and the code used for S&amp;P 2023 paper <em>[On The Empirical Effectiveness of Unrealistic Adversarial Hardening Against Realistic Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03277)</em>. 
The paper investigates whether "cheap" unrealistic adversarial attacks can be used to harden ML models against computationally expensive realistic attacks. 
The paper studies 3 use cases (text, botnet, malware) and at least one realistic and unrealistic attack for each of them. 



The data used for the results analysis can be downloaded all in this [link](https://uniluxembourg-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/salijona_dyrmishi_uni_lu/Eo3LPuU7nVJBs5UyHEBadU8BkOOJHnCFXdGE55dNbCETow?e=YTyCXn). 
To download only the data you are interested in please continue reading below. 


### 1. Text classification
We consider two attacks: [Deepwordbug](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04354)(unrealistic) and [TextFooler](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11932)(realistic).

We use [Textattack](https://textattack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library from the command line to train the models and evaluate their adversarial robustness. 
You will find all the models presented in the paper in this [link](https://uniluxembourg-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/salijona_dyrmishi_uni_lu/EShqUwlR76xNttj4_BPuOU0BrY854BrNlkm84adN3wRpqQ?e=rrncfb).
In the config files of each model you can see the training parameters, including the attack used for the hardening. This [file](https://uniluxembourg-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/salijona_dyrmishi_uni_lu/ES71tvRvV1pBl9thHzz0AA8BpVDzoTXv4yVMURyQuVs9uw?e=ct4uwh)
provides an easy way to identify the models. 


### 2. Botnet detection
As an unrealistic attack we use the PGD implementation of [ART](https://adversarial-robustness-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. <br>
For the realistic attack we use the [FENCE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10480.pdf) attack by Chernikova et al. Our implementation in this repo includes updates from TensorFlow 1
to TensorFlow 2, code refactoring and as well as bug fixes. However you can access the original repository by authors [here](https://github.com/achernikova/cybersecurity_evasion) if needed.

### 3. Malware detection
We use 3 attacks: PGD and [MoEvA2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01156) (unrealistic) and [AIMED](https://www.rapha.ai/files/AIMED.pdf) (realistic).

Again for PGD we use the ART implementation. <br>
For MoEvA2 we use and include in this repo an early version called Coeva2. If you are interested, the latest release by the authors can be found [here](https://github.com/serval-uni-lu/moeva2-ijcai22-replication). <br>
For AIMED we use and include in this repo a lighter version with only the necessary functionalities needed for this study. For the full code and functionalities check the authors original version in [here](https://github.com/zRapha/AIMED)
